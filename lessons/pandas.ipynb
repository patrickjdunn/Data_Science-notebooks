    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of a larger project that contains **many datasets** stored in a shared `data/` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this notebook lives in the `lessons/` folder, we cannot assume that the current working directory is the project root. Instead, we programmatically locate the project root and then build paths from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach prevents common file-not-found errors and works even if notebooks are moved to different folders.\n",

    "* Dataset name\n",
    "* Number of rows\n",
    "* Number of columns\n",

    "* Missing values\n",

    "Mastering this workflow will make your future analyses:\n",
